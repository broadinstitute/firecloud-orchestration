/**
 * Created by dvoet on 7/21/15.
 *
 * Copied wholesale from rawls on 15-Oct-2015, commit a9664c9f08d0681d6647e6611fd0c785aa8aa24a
 *
 * modified to also include sub, retrieved from the OIDC_CLAIM_sub header.
 * I could have removed the userEmail, accessToken, and accessTokenExpiresIn because we don't
 * use those in orchestration. However, they're quite lightweight, and I've left them in to keep diffs between
 * orchestration and rawls as clean as possible.
 *
  * Amended 11/16/2016:
  *  Added trait WithAccessToken, which is extended by the existing UserInfo class as well as a new AccessToken class
  *  This is so that we can use AccessToken for cookies we get from the browser, which do not come with the fields in
  *  UserInfo.
